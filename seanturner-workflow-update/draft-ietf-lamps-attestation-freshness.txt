  Nonce-based Freshness for Remote Attestation in Certificate Signing
Requests (CSRs) for the Certification Management Protocol (CMP) and for
                 Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST)
             draft-ietf-lamps-attestation-freshness-latest

Abstract

   When an end entity includes attestation Evidence in a Certificate
   Signing Request (CSR), it may be necessary to demonstrate the
   freshness of the provided Evidence.  Current attestation technology
   commonly achieves this using nonces.

   This document outlines the process through which nonces are supplied
   to the end entity by an RA/CA for inclusion in Evidence, leveraging
   the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) and Enrollment over Secure
   Transport (EST)

1.  Introduction

   The management of certificates, encompassing issuance, CA certificate
   provisioning, renewal, and revocation, has been streamlined through
   standardized protocols.

   The Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis]
   defines messages for X.509v3 certificate creation and management.
   CMP facilitates interactions between end entities and PKI management
   entities, such as Registration Authorities (RAs) and Certification
   Authorities (CAs).  For Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), CMP
   primarily utilizes the Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)
   [RFC4211] but also supports PKCS#10 [RFC2986].

   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) ([RFC7030], [RFC8295]) is
   another certificate management protocol that provides a subset of
   CMP's features, primarily using PKCS#10 for CSRs.

   When an end entity requests a certificate from a Certification
   Authority (CA), it may need to assert credible claims about the
   protections of the corresponding private key, such as the use of a
   hardware security module or the protective capabilities provided by
   the hardware, as well as claims about the platform itself.

   To include these claims as Evidence in remote attestation, the remote
   attestation extension [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] has been
   defined.  It specifies how Evidence produced by an Attester is
   encoded for inclusion in CRMF or PKCS#10, along with any necessary
   certificates for its validation.

   For a Verifier or Relying Party to ensure the freshness of the
   Evidence, knowing the exact time of its production is crucial.
   Current attestation technologies, like [TPM20] and [RFC9783], often
   employ nonces to ensure the freshness of Evidence.  Further details
   on ensuring Evidence freshness can be found in Section 10 of
   [RFC9334].

   Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] provides examples where
   a CSR contains one or more Evidence statements.  For each Evidence
   statement the end entity may wish to request a separate nonce.

   Since an end entity requires one or more nonces from one or more
   Verifier via the RA/CA, an additional roundtrip is necessary.
   However, a CSR is a one-shot message.  Therefore, CMP and EST enable
   the end entity to request information from the RA/CA before
   submitting a certification request conveniently.

   Once a nonce is obtained, the end entity invokes the API on an
   Attester, providing the nonce as an input parameter.  The Attester
   then returns an Evidence, which is embedded into a CSR and
   potentially together with further Evidence statements, submitted back
   to the RA/CA in a certification request message.

   Figure 1 illustrates this interaction:

   *  One or more nonces are requested in step (0) and obtained in step
      (1) using the extension to CMP/EST defined in this document.

   *  The CSR extension [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] conveys one or
      more Evidence statements to the RA/CA in step (2).

   *  One ore more Verifier process the received Evidence and return the
      Attestation Result(s) to the Relying Party.  The CA uses the
      Attestation Result(s) with the Appraisal Policy and other
      information to create the requested certificate.  The certificate
      is returned to the End Entity in step (3).

   The functionality described in this document is divided into two
   sections:

   *  Section 3 describes how to convey the nonce using CMP.

   *  Section 4 describes the equivalent functionality for EST.

2.  Terminology and Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms Attester, Relying Party, Verifier and Evidence are defined
   in [RFC9334].  The terms end entity, certification authority (CA),
   and registration authority (RA) are defined in [RFC5280].

   We use the terms Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and certification
   request interchangeably.

3.  Conveying a Nonce in CMP

   Section 5.3.19 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis] defines the general
   request message (genm) and general response (genp).  The NonceRequest
   payload of the genm message, sent by the end entity to request a
   nonce, optionally includes details on the required length of the
   nonce from the Attester.  The NonceResponse payload of the genp
   message, sent by the CA/RA in response to the request, contains the
   nonce itself.

    GenMsg:    {id-it TBD1}, NonceRequestValue
    GenRep:    {id-it TBD2}, NonceResponseValue | < absent >

    id-it-nonceRequest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-it TBD1 }
    NonceRequestValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF NonceRequest
    NonceRequest ::= SEQUENCE {
       len INTEGER OPTIONAL,
       -- indicates the required length of the requested nonce
       type EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}) OPTIONAL,
       -- indicates which Evidence type to request a nonce for
       hint UTF8String OPTIONAL
       -- indicates which Verifier to request a nonce from
    }

    id-it-nonceResponse OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-it TBD2 }
    NonceResponseValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF NonceResponse
    NonceResponse ::= SEQUENCE {
       nonce OCTET STRING,
       -- contains the nonce of length len
       -- provided by the Verifier indicated with hint
       expiry INTEGER OPTIONAL,
       -- indicates how long in seconds the Verifier considers
       -- the nonce valid
       type EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}) OPTIONAL,
       -- indicates which Evidence type to request a nonce for
       hint UTF8String OPTIONAL
       -- indicates which Verifier to request a nonce from
    }

   The end entity may request one or more nonces for different Verifier.
   The EVIDENCE-STATEMENT type is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  They allow the Attester to specify
   to the Relying Party which Verifier should be contacted to obtain a
   nonce.  If a NonceRequest structure does not contain type or hint,
   the RA/CA should respond with a nonce it MAY generated by itself.

   The use of the general request/response message exchange introduces
   an additional roundtrip for transmitting nonce(s) from the CA/RA to
   the end entity (and subsequently to the Attester within the end
   entity).

   The end entity MUST construct a id-it-nonceRequest message to prompt
   the RA/CA to send a nonce(s) in response.  The message may contain
   one or more NonceRequest structures, at a maximum one per Evidence
   statement the end entity wishes to provide in a CSR.  If a
   NonceRequest structure does neither contain a type nor a hint, the
   RA/CA MAY generate a nonce itself and provide it in the respective
   NonceResponse structure.  If an RA/CA is not able to provide a
   requested nonce, it MUST provide an empty OCTET STRING in the
   respective NonceResponse structure.

   NonceRequest, NonceResponse, and EvidenceStatement structures can
   contain a type field and a hint field.  In terms of type and hint
   content, the order in which the NonceRequest structures were sent in
   the request message MUST match the order of the NonceResponse
   structures in the response message and the EvicenceStatements in the
   CSR later.  This is important so that the RA/CA can send the Evidence
   statement to the Verifier who generated the nonce used by the
   Attester who generated it.

   When receiving nonces from the RA/CA in a id-it-nonceResponse
   message, the end entity MUST use them to request Evidence Statements
   from the respective Attester optionally indicated by type and hint.
   If a nonce is provides in a NonceResponse structure without
   indicating any type or hint, it can be used for all Evidence
   statements requiring a nonce.

   An Evidence statement generated using a nonce provided with an expiry
   value will be accepted by the Verifyer as valid until the respective
   expiry time elapsed.  It is expected that the respective messages are
   delivered in a timely manner.

   The interaction is illustrated in Figure 2.

               --<<--- certification response ---<<--
   Handle response
   Store certificate

   *: These steps require interactions with the Attester
   (on the EE side) and with the Verifier (on the RA/CA side).

   If HTTP is used to transfer the NonceRequest and NonceResponse
   messages, the OPTIONAL <operation> path segment defined in
   Section 3.6 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis] MAY be used.

    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+
    | Operation              |Operation path   | Details           |
    +========================+=================+===================+
    | Get Attestation        | getnonce        | {{CMP}}           |
    | Freshness Nonce        |                 |                   |
    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

   If CoAP is used for transferring NonceRequest and NonceResponse
   messages, the OPTIONAL <operation> path segment defined in
   Section 2.1 of [RFC9482] MAY be used.

    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+
    | Operation              |Operation path   | Details           |
    +========================+=================+===================+

    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

4.  Conveying a Nonce in EST

   The EST client requests one or more nonces for its Attester from the
   EST server.  This function typically follows the request for CA
   certificates and precedes other EST operations.

   The EST server MUST support the path-prefix of "/.well-known/" as
   defined in [RFC5785] and the registered name of "est".  Therefore, a
   valid EST server URI path begins with "https://www.example.com/.well-
   known/est".  Each EST operation is indicated by a path-suffix that
   specifies the intended operation.

   The following operation is defined by this specification:

    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+
    | Operation              |Operation path   | Details           |
    +========================+=================+===================+
    | Retrieval of a nonce   | /nonce          | {{EST}}           |
    +------------------------+-----------------+-------------------+

   The operation path is appended to the path-prefix to form the URI
   used with HTTP GET or POST to perform the desired EST operation.  An
   example of a valid URI absolute path for the "/nonce" operation is
   "/.well-known/est/nonce".

4.1.  Request Methods

   An EST client uses either a GET or a POST method, depending on
   whether additional parameters need to be conveyed:

   *  A GET request MUST be used when the EST client does not want to
      convey extra parameters.

   *  A POST request MUST be used when parameters, such as nonce length
      or a hint about the verification service, are included in the
      request.

    +------------------+------------------------------+---------------+
    | Message type     | Media type(s)                | Reference     |
    | (per operation)  |                              |               |
    +==================+==============================+===============+
    | Nonce Request    | N/A (for GET) or             | This section  |
    |                  | application/json (for POST)  |               |
    +==================+==============================+===============+
    | Nonce Response   | application/json             | This section  |
    |                  |                              |               |
    +==================+==============================+===============+

4.2.  Example Requests

   To retrieve one nonce without providing length, type, or hint using a
   GET request:

   GET /.well-known/est/nonce HTTP/1.1

   To retrieve one or more nonces while specifying the length, type,
   and/or hint using a POST request:

   POST /.well-known/est/nonce HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   [
     {
       "len": 8,
       "type": "<OID>",
       "hint": "https://example.com"
     },
     ...
   ]

   < ToDo: Fix the json structure regarding the sequence of len, type,
   and hint and how the OID for type shall be encoded. >

   The payload in a POST request MUST be of content-type "application/
   json" and MUST contain an array of JSON objects [RFC7159] containing
   "len", "type", and "hint" members The optional member "len"
   indicating the length of the requested nonce value in bytes.  The
   optional "type" (containing an EvicenceStatement OID as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation]) and "hint" members (containing an
   FQDN based on the definition in the EvidenceHint structure as defined
   in [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation]) indicate the Verifyer to use.

4.3.  Server Response

   If successful, the EST server MUST respond with an HTTP 200 status
   code and a content-type of "application/json", containing an array of
   JSON objects [RFC7159] with the "nonce" member.  The "expiry" member
   is optional and indicates the validity period of the nonce.  The
   optional "type" and "hint" members are copied from the request.

   The EST server MAY request HTTP-based client authentication, as
   explained in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC7030].

   Below is an example response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   [
     {
       "nonce": "MTIzNDU2Nzg5MDEyMzQ1Njc4OTAxMjM0NTY3ODkwMTI=",
       "expiry": "2031-10-12T07:20:50.52Z"
       "type": "<OID>",
       "hint": "https://example.com"
     },
     ...
   ]

   < ToDo: Fix the json structure regarding the sequence of len, type,
   and hint and how the OID for type shall be encoded. >

   Open Issue: Should a specific content type be registered for use with
   EST over CoAP, where the nonce and expiry fields are encoded in a
   CBOR structure?

5.  Nonce Processing Guidelines

   When the RA/CA is requested to provide a nonce to an end entity, it
   interacts with the Verifier.  According to the IETF RATS architecture
   [RFC9334], the Verifier is responsible for validating Evidence about
   an Attester and generating Attestation Results for use by a Relying
   Party.  The Verifier also acts as the source of the nonce to prevent
   replay attacks.

   The nonce value MUST contain a random byte sequence whereby the
   length depends on the used remote attestation technology as specific
   nonce length may be required by the end entity.  This specification
   assumes that the RA/CA possesses knowledge, either out-of-band or
   through the len field in the NonceRequest, regarding the required
   nonce length for the attestation technology.  Nonces of incorrect
   length will cause the remote attestation protocol to fail.

   For instance, the PSA attestation token [RFC9783] supports nonce
   lengths of 32, 48, and 64 bytes.  Other attestation technologies
   employ nonces of similar lengths.

   If a specific length was requested, the RA/CA must provide a nonce of
   that size.  The end entity MUST use the received nonce if the remote
   attestation supports the requested length.  If necessary, the end
   entity MAY adjust the length of the nonce by truncating or padding it
   accordingly.

   While this specification does not address the semantics of the
   attestation API or the underlying software/hardware architecture, the
   API returns Evidence from the Attester in a format specific to the
   attestation technology used and specified by the type and hint.  The
   returned Evidence is encapsulated within the CSR, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  The software generating the CSR
   treats the Evidence as an opaque blob and does not interpret its
   format.  It's crucial to note that the nonce is included in the
   Evidence, either implicitly or explicitly, and MUST NOT be conveyed
   in CSR structures outside of the Evidence payload.

   The processing of CSRs containing Evidence is detailed in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].  Importantly, certificates issued
   based on this process do not contain the nonce, as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds new entries to the "CMP Well-Known URI Path
   Segments" registry defined in [RFC8615].

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification details the process of obtaining a nonce via CMP
   and EST, assuming that the nonce does not require confidentiality
   protection while maintaining the security properties of the remote
   attestation protocol.  [RFC9334] defines the IETF remote attestation
   architecture and extensively discusses nonce-based freshness.

   Section 8.4 of [RFC9711] specifies requirements for the randomness
   and privacy of nonce generation when used with the Entity Attestation
   Token (EAT).  These requirements, which are also adopted by
   attestation technologies like the PSA attestation token [RFC9783],
   provide general utility:

   *  The nonce MUST have at least 64 bits of entropy.

   *  To prevent disclosure of privacy-sensitive information, it should
      be derived using a salt from a genuinely random number generator
      or another reliable source of randomness.

   Each attestation technology specification offers guidance on replay
   protection using nonces and other techniques.  Specific
   recommendations are deferred to these individual specifications in
   this document.

   Regarding the use of Evidence in a CSR, the security considerations
   outlined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-csr-attestation] are pertinent to this
   specification.
